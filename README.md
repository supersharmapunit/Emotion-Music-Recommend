Music for the Mind: Identify a user's emotional state from a picture or video, and recommend suitable music to fit and/or improve their mood.

# Emotion-Music-Recommendation
Recommending music based on your facial expressions using FER 2013 dataset 

# Project Description:
The project employs an emotion recognition model trained on the FER 2013 dataset, capable of identifying seven different emotions in real-time video feed captured from a webcam. Based on the identified emotion, the app recommends a playlist of songs that match the user's emotional state. The recommended songs are displayed on the screen using a Modern UI design for the website. This allows the user to choose and listen to music that fits their emotional state, enhancing their mood and overall well-being.
